# Task-2
Data Visualization and Storytelling
This Tableau project presents a complete visual analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset through interactive dashboards and storytelling. It covers key business areas including sales performance, profitability by category, seasonal trends, delivery efficiency, and customer loyalty using a Pareto chart. The story begins with a KPI overview, followed by detailed insights into which categories and sub-categories drive profits, how sales vary month-to-month (highlighting high seasons), and which states face delivery delays despite high sales. The final dashboard applies the 80/20 rule, showing that the top 20% of customers contribute to nearly 80% of sales. Each dashboard includes filters, tooltips, icons, and annotations to make insights clear and engaging. This project demonstrates a strong grasp of data visualization, storytelling, and business analytics using Tableau.
